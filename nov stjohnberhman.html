     THE LIFE OF SAINT JOHN
     BERCHMANS, S. J. <br>
     THE BEAUTIFUL title of 'The Angel Saints' has
     been given to that triad of exquisite flowers of
     dazzling purity which bloomed in the garden of the
     Society of Jesus: St. Aloysius, St. Stanislaus, and St.
     John Berchmans. These very blossoms unfolded
     their stainless petals just sufficiently to let us dimly
     guess at the beauty which lay concealed within their
     hearts to be unfolded as these radiant blossoms
     developed into full flower. 'Angel' was the term
     applied to them by those amongst whom these holy
     youths lived and died. It was the highest expression
     of their wonder and admiration, and conveys to us,
     with marvellous force and accuracy, the impression
     the Saints produced on those around them. If one of
     the angelic spirits who surround the Throne of God
     was permitted to come down on earth in mortal
     guise, it seemed to men that he would look like
     these whose earthly forms reflected the beauty of
     their souls.
     Eminent sanctity is ever and always attractive,
     but especially is it so to the children of men when to
     it is allied the ineffable charm and grace of early
     youth united to the most stainless innocence. The
     hardest-hearted, the most worldly, are touched by
     this supernatural sight and, driven as they are to
     seek an explanation of the phenomenon in
     supernatural causes, they apply the term which so
     fittingly describes it-'Angel.'
    <h1> BIRTH OF ST. JOHN BERCHMANS</h1>
     MIDWAY BETWEEN Antwerp and Maestricht lies
     Diest, an ancient town with a fine market-place,
     narrow, medieval streets, and strange old houses,
     with curious pointed gables. A sleepy old Flemish
     town of the Middle Ages, there is nothing within its
     walls to arrest the attention of the ordinary tourist. .
     But to the Catholic it possesses the supreme interest
     of being the birthplace of a Saint-one of the 'Angel
     Saints.'
     Leading from the market-town is a narrow
     street, on the left of which a house, three stories
     high, attracts the traveller's attention, not indeed,
     because of anything remarkable in its architecture. It
     is unassuming in style, and the front seems of
     recent construction. But in the centre of this house
     is a niche, and within this niche stands the statue of
     a youth, in the habit of a religious, holding in his
     hands, which are clasped, a book, a rosary, and a
     crucifix. Underneath an inscription tells us that this
     is 'The house of Blessed Berchmans.' Here our Saint
     was born, on Saturday, the 13 th of March 1599. The
     room in which he first opened his eyes upon those
     earthly scenes is still shown, but it is in a sadly
     dilapidated condition.
    <h1>PARENTS OF ST. JOHN BERCHMANS</h1>
     TOWARDS THE CLOSE Of the sixteenth century
     there dwelt in this house, then known as the sign of
     'The Great and the Little Moon,' a worthy citizen of
     Diest named Charles John Berchmans. He was a
     man of stainless integrity, and stood high in the
     esteem of his fellow-townsmen, by whom he was
     elected to some of the most important posts in the
     Municipal Council. The reigning sovereign, Archduke
     Albert, had also appointed him echevin, or one of
     ten magistrates appointed to keep the peace of the
     city. His father had held the post, and so had two of
     his brothers.
     The Berchmans were among the best families in
     the place, but, like all the Flemings, they did not
     disdain trade. Hence, Charles Berchmans followed
     the avocation of a cordwainer, or shoemaker, at the
     sign of 'The Great and the Little Moon.'
     Berchmans' wife, Elizabeth Vanden Hove, was a
     member of a very rich, influential family of Diest.
     Although not of older or gentler descent than the
     Berchmans, the Vanden Hoves, by means of their
     wealth, had attained to a far higher position in the
     social world. We are told that no cordial relations
     would seem to have existed between the two
     families. Hence, we may infer that the wealthy
     Vanden Hoves resented the marriage of a poor
     Berchmans with a daughter of their house.
     Both Charles Berchmans and his wife were
     regarded by the people of Diest as models of piety
     and virtue, Their family consisted of four sons and
     one daughter, and the pious couple spared no effort
     to train these souls committed to their care, from
     their earliest years, to walk in the paths of holiness
     and virtue.
     <h1>ST. JOHN BERCHMAN'S CHILDHOOD OUR SAINT</h1> 
     as we have seen, was born on a
     Saturday, and on the following day he was .taken to
     the parish church of St. Sulpice, and there baptised,
     receiving his father's second name, John. The old
     church, much defaced by the storms of troublesome
     times through which it has passed, still stands in the
     market-place, and in the yellow pages of the ancient
     baptismal register may still be traced the entryof the
     saint's baptism.
     From his earliest years John manifested the
     most unalterable sweetness of disposition. Long
     afterwards, when he had passed away to heaven,
     those who had known him in his early years loved
     to recall how visibly God had set his seal upon him
     even from infancy.
     Of a joyous, bright, disposition, never was his
     sunny brow clouded by childish petulance or ill-
     humour. Naturally vivacious and ardent, he was
     never seen to give way to temper or impatience.
     Even when abused and ill-treated by other boys, as
     will, of course, sometimes happen amongst boys,
     John bore all meekly and without complaint.
     He was sent, when very young, to a day-school.
     It sometimes happened on his return that his knocks
     at the housedoor passed unnoticed, whereupon the
     holy child would steal away to the church of St.
     Sulpice, and there, kneeling at the foot of Our Lady's
     statue, he would recite five or six rosaries. When not
     yet seven years of age, he was in the habit of rising
     before daybreak. His grandmother remonstrated with
     him for getting up so early, upon which the little
     fellow made answer: 'Oh! dear grandmamma, I must
     serve my two or three Masses before school-time.
     What better place could there be to win knowledge
     quickly and surely?'
    <h1> HIS .MOTHER'S ILLNESS</h1>
     JOHN HAD barely reached his ninth year when
     his mother was stricken with the mortal malady
     which for eight weary years confined her to a bed of
     suffering. Our Saint loved his mother tenderly, and
     he was ever at her side, ministering to her, cheering
     her, consoling her with such words of saintly
     wisdom as filled those who heard him with
     amazement. In her moments of greatest suffering
     the presence of her angelic little son soothed and
     consoled the poor mother.
     John was indeed the most wining and attractive
     of boys. Everyone loved him, but, child as he was,
     he shrank from observation and shunned society.
     He never left his home except to go to school or to
     the church. His master bears witness to his retiring,
     modest disposition. 'Nowhere,' he tells us, 'did he
     see him so often as in the church; nowhere so
     seldom as in the streets.'
    <h1> JOHN'S FUTURE GLORY PREDICTED</h1>
     JOHN BERCHMANS seems to have manifested
     from an early age remarkable talent and aptitude for
     study. His master, Wouter Van Stiphout, kept his
     school in the medieval cloth-market, which still, at
     the present day, is used as the public school. When
     John reached his eleventh year, he was entrusted to
     Stiphout's care, and in a very short time succeeding
     in gaining his deep and lasting affection. Stiphout
     loved this beautiful, saintly boy, and to his love was
     united admiration for his brilliant gifts. John was,
     indeed, a pupil to be proud of.
     Diligent, painstaking, he quickly outstripped all
     his young companions. 'I looked upon him,' says
     Stiphout, 'as a sort of natural wonder. I praised him
     before my scholars, and proposed him to them as a
     model for their emulation. One day, when his father
     was asking me how he was getting on, I recollect
     saying: 'How blessed you are in such a son! He will
     be your consolation, andmy honour and glory.'' Truly
     prophetic words, which in a few years were to
     receive such glorious fulfilment.
    <h1> VOCATION FOR THE PRIESTHOOD</h1>
     OUR SAINT'S vocation was never for a moment
     uncertain. His pure, spotless heart never held any
     desire, knew any ambition, save that of serving his
     God at the altar. His father, urged by Stiphout's
     earnest words, consented to allow his son to obey
     the call of God, and to put on the clerical dress.
     At that time the parish priest of the church of
     Our Lady in Diest was a Premonstratensian monk
     named Father Peter Emmerick. This religious had
     gathered round him at the presbytery a number of
     pious youths with vocations for the priesthood, this
     forming, as it were, a sort of seminary.
     Just at this time John's father found himself m
     very straitened circumstances; but, notwithstanding,
     he determined to send his son to Father Peter
     Emmerick. Charles Berchmans' lively faith and
     fervent piety caused him to shrink from no sacrifice-
     whereby his children's welfare, above all, their
     spiritual welfare, might be secured. And God richly
     re- warded those sacrifices.
    <h1>JOHN'S NEW LIFE</h1>
     FROM THE DAY that John Berchmans left his
     father's house to go to Father Peter Emmerick he
     scarcely ever visited it. He still continued to attend
     Stiphout's school, which was quite near to his old
     home, but the new home at the presbytery of Notre
     Dame seems to have filled his heart completely.
     Very won derful is the record left to us of this
     boy's life during those years spent with Father
     Emmerick. It was his delight to serve Mass, which
     he did with the most .profound recollection. He
     loved to hear the Word of God, and he would sit
     drinking in the preacher's words with a thoughtful
     gravity befitting one of maturer years. He was
     extremely reticent, never speaking but when spoken
     to, and then his words were very few and
     measured. Withal he was a merry, bright boy.
     <h1>YOUTHFUL VIRTUE</h1>
     JOHN'S OBEDIENCE was prompt and
     unquestioning, and he was ever ready to serve
     others. He contrived that a good portion of the
     servants' work should fall to him, and he would take
     his books and sit near the door, so as to attend
     promptly to the bell. It fell oftener to his turn to
     read in the refectory than to any of the others. He
     specially delighted in the Book of Proverbs, the Lives
     of the Saints, and the Passion of Our Divine Lord.
     Boys as a rule delight in eating, but John never
     thought about his food. He took everything that was
     given to him, never finding fault with anything. He
     ate sparingly, and when in the refectory seemed so
     abstracted that those around him used to make
     jokes, telling him that his mind went to travel
     whenever he went to the refectory. All this
     mortification and recollection did not prevent our
     young Saint from being the brightest and sweetest of
     companions. Everyone loved him. Never was he
     known to dispute or quarrel. He often acted as
     peacemaker in his companions' quarrels, and if he
     found that be could not restore harmony he would
     quietly slip away.
    <h1>LOVE OF PRAYER</h1>
     WE HAVE SEEN how even in early childhood
     John shrank from going amongst people. This
     dislike to society grew with his youth. His first
     master, Stiphout, declared that his aversion to the
     world arose from the exquisite delicacy and purity of
     his conscience: 'John was ever so simple and
     innocent, that he did not even know by name vices
     to which boyhood has too often an inclination. And
     this was why he kept away so much from his
     companions.'
     During the recreation hour, he would stay in his
     room engaged in prayer or study until his master,
     fearing the effect of such application upon his
     health, forced him to join his companions.
     Sometimes he would be found in the most out-ofthe-
     way corners in the house absorbed in prayer.
    <h1>FIRST COMMUNION</h1>
     IT WAS DURING his stay with Father Emmerick
     that St. John Berchmans made his First
     Communion, being at the time between eleven and
     twelve years of age. Who can tell with what burning
     love and fervent piety he prepared to receive his
     Divine Lord into his pure heart! He made his general
     confession to Father. Emmerick, who was filled with
     awe and' admiration at the seraphic beauty and
     purity of that young soul. He tells us that he could
     not restrain his tears when he saw the 'angel who
     was at my feet, all bathed with tears, as with
     deepest contrition he accused himself of the lightest
     faults.' So great was John's innocence that for some
     time Father Lmmerick hesitated about giving him
     absolution, in doubt that there was sufficient matter
     in his confession.
     When the great day at last arrived, the day so
     long desired, so ardently looked forward to, the Saint
     received his Hidden God from Father Emmerick's
     hands, in the venerable church of Notre Dame. More
     than ever, like an angel was the holy child at that
     moment: The venerable priest declared that the
     boy's face was radiant shining with the light of
     purity and the burning love which consumed him.,
     John's First Communion proved for him as indeed it
     does for all children, an epoch in his life.
     Henceforth he advanced in the path of holiness with
     great strides. His love of God grew daily greater. His
     whole soul was, as it were, on fire with love for his
     Lord. The sacred Name of Jesus, the first his
     mother had taught his babylips to utter, filled him
     with ecstacy. Let us quote from his master again:
     'When he began to make progress in Latin
     versification, I gave him leave to choose a subject
     for a theme in verse. He brought me an eulogy on
     the Name of Jesus, so full of meaning, tenderness,
     and unction, that it was easy to surmise, even then,
     that one day he would enter the Society of Jesus.' A
     copy of this poem, in which John strove to express
     his pure heart's burning love for Jesus, is still
     preserved in the Royal Library in Brussels.
     While living in the presbytery of Notre Dame, St.
     John Berchmans went to confession every week,
     and he received Holy Communion twice during the
     month as well as on all great feasts.
     <h1>HIS LOVE FOR OUR BLESSED LADY</h1>
     SECOND ONLY to his love for Jesus, was that
     felt by our Saint for Mary. From his infancy he had
     the most childlike trust and confidence in her. The
     mere mention of our Lady brought a heavenly smile
     to his beautiful face, and when he spoke of her
     there was a light in his eye, and a tenderness in his
     voice, which revealed the depth of his love. All the
     witnesses for the cause of his beatification testified
     to the Saint's extraordinary devotion to the
     Immaculate ;Mother of God. He never passed a
     statue of our Lady without saluting it, he never left
     the church without paying a visit to Mary's altar. He
     used to deprive himself of a portion of every meal in
     her honour, and many and ingenious were his
     contrivances to hide this.
     The Queen of Purity showed how acceptable to
     her was the love and devotion of this spotless young
     heart. She shielded her favourite from the lightest
     breath of evil. The lily of spotless purity bloomed in
     angelic loveliness in John's heart. Innocent as he
     was of even the name of vice, a supernatural
     instinct caused him to shrink with horror from the
     slightest thing that could tarnish the lustre of his
     virginal purity. He would never allow anyone to
     touch him, and the least levity in words or action on
     the part of any of his companions caused him to
     shun the delinquent's company.
     SHRINE OF OUR LADY OF MONTAIGU
     ABOUT A LEAGUE from Diest, on the summit of
     a very high hill, stands the Sanctuary of Our Lady of
     Montaigu, especially dear to the Belgians. The
     stately church which crowns the hill top was not
     completed until after our Saint had passed to
     Heaven. The foundation-stone was laid by the
     Archdukes Albert and Isabella; but the good Albert
     did not live to see its completion eighteen years
     later.
     John made repeated pilgrimages to the Shrine
     of our Lady of Moritaigu. There was nothing he
     loved better than to walk from Diest to the
     Sanctuary, observing strict silence as he went,
     meditating on our Lady, and reciting her Rosary.
     TROUBLES
     CLOUDS WERE gathering over the Saint's
     peaceful life of prayer and study in the presbytery of
     Notre Dame. Charles Berchmans' financial
     difficulties had not lessened, rather they had grown
     greater. His wife's last illness had entailed heavy
     expenses, to say nothing of the serious loss which
     the want of her presence and prudent management
     was to his home. Business was bad, and his other
     children were growing up and required education. In
     his sore straits, the father's thoughts turned to his
     eldest son, now nearly fourteen. John was a youth
     of exceptional talent, so his masters averred. Surely
     he could be of some use now. At least he could
     help his father in his business, and relieve him of
     the burden of his support. Accordingly, John was
     sent for from school, all unconscious of the blow
     about to fall upon him. 'You see, my child,' said his
     father, 'it is impossible for me any longer to bear the
     expense of your schooling. Up to this I have made
     great sacrifices, but I feel it impossible for me to
     continue them. It seems to me you must learn a
     good trade. You will by this means be able to be of
     great use to us, and, instead of being a burden to
     your family, be a real assistance.'
     JOHN'S SORROW
     WHO CAN describe our Saint's sorrow as he
     stood by his mother's bed and heard his father's
     words? We are told that he threw himself at his
     father's feet, and with bitter tears supplicated, first
     his father, then his mother, not to take him from the
     service of God at the altar. 'You know, father,'
     entreated the weeping boy, 'God calls me to the
     Church. A little longer, and I shall be able to follow
     that holy calling. In Heaven's name, do not hinder
     my happiness. As to the expense, you shall have no
     reason to be alarmed on that score. I will be.
     content with so little you shall not suffer. I can live
     on bread and water. But, pray, do not refuse me
     permission to continue my studies.'
     Charles Berchmans, as we know, was a man of
     true piety; he was also a tender father. The sight of
     his boy's distress affected him to tears, and we
     cannot doubt but that the suffering mother felt an
     added pang at seeing her angel son, the solace of
     her life, so wrung with anguish. Charles raised the
     weeping boy, and poured balm into his troubled
     heart by promising to reconsider his decision.
     JOHN LEAVES DIEST FOR MECHLIN
     CHARLES BERCHMAN held anxious council with
     his wife as to how their son's holy desires might be
     gratified. The result of their deliberations was that
     the elder Berchmans set himself to seek for some
     place where John would receive board and
     education in return for his domestic services. To us
     this sounds a strange arrangement, but one, it
     seems, quite usual in those days, where there were
     but few ecclesiastical colleges. Before long the
     desired place was found in the house of a Canon in
     Mechlin.
     Great was the grief of the people of Diest when
     they found that the angel-boy, whom all loved, was
     going to leave them. Listen to his old master,
     Stipbout: 'While I was congratulating myself on
     having such a pupil, and was enjoying in peace this
     favour from heaven, when my townsmen, with one
     voice, gave him the title of the flower of the school
     and the pride of the scholars, some persons who
     envied my good fortune, tried to get his father to
     send him to Mechlin.' Poor man! Can you not
     sympathise with him in his grief at losing his saintly
     pupil? Years afterwards, when he was called on as a
     witness in the case of John's beatification, he
     revealed how deep and lasting was his sorrow for
     his angelpupil. 'Life has been very bitter to me,' says
     the old man, 'since I lost that holy child.'
     Our Saint had a loving heart, and we cannot
     doubt but that he, too, felt the paring from father,
     mother, all he loved. But God was calling him, and
     the Saint obeyed that call promptly, without pausing
     to count the cost, as is the way of saints.
     Early in 1614, St. John Berchmans bade
     farewell to home and friends, and wended his way
     to Mechlin, then the primatial city of Belgium.
     HIS NEW HOME
     CANON JOHN FROYMONT, of whose household
     John now found himself a member, was not long in
     discovering the treasure of holiness whom God had
     sent to him. Like all who came in contact with the
     Saint, he conceived the warmest affection for him,
     an affection which neither time nor distance ever
     chilled. The Canon kept a number of boys of good
     family committed to his care. John, at once, on his
     arrival, assumed the lowest place in the household,
     and undertook to perform the most menial offices,
     washing plates and dishes, sweeping the yard, etc.,
     But the Canon, who soon came to regard John in
     the light of a dear son, would not allow him to
     continue in such a menial position. He gave him the
     charge of three little boys, brothers, and in this
     manner satisfied John's scruples on the score of
     working for his living. Our Saint was, indeed, an
     earthly guardian-angel to those children, watching
     over them, instructing them and leading them to God
     with true and unwearied care.
     As at Diest, so at Mechlin, John won the
     admiration and love of everyone. His modesty, his
     charming manner and appearance took all hearts by
     storm. No one could look at the beautiful boy
     without feeling convinced that a soul of dazzling
     purity and holiness dwelt in the angel-like form. He
     lived for God alone, and in all places, at all times,
     his heart was turned to Him as a flower turns to the
     sun. Young men of the highest families in Mechlin
     sought his company, lowly as was his position. John
     was affable and courteous to all, but no amount of
     notice could disturb his deep humility, or cause a
     breath of vanity to ruffle his pure heart. He
     maintained a calm, reserve, yet was ever courteous
     and obliging, willing to spend himself for others.
     Sundays John devoted wholly to prayer and
     God's service. He used to hear two, sometimes three
     Masses, kneeling, without moving, and always was
     present at the Sunday sermon and vespers.
     ST. JOHN BERCHMANS ATTENDS THE JESUIT
     COLLEGE
     IN 1615 the Jesuit Fathers, at the request of the
     civil authorities, opened a public college in Mechlin.
     John with some other of Canon Froymont's pupils,
     was among the earliest alumni of the new college.
     John, who attended as a day scholar, was judged fit,
     on presenting himself, to become one ofthe
     'Rhetoric' class, the highest in classical studies.
     In this new sphere, the Saint redoubled his zeal.
     He was a model to the whole college of every virtue.
     He scrupulously obeyed his masters, even in the
     most trivial points. He was the most fervent and
     edifying of the members of the Sodality of the
     Blessed Virgin. Every day, we are told, he recited,
     prostrate on the ground, the Office of the Blessed
     Virgin; whilst on Saturdays, and the eves of her
     great feasts he fasted in our Lady's honour. He
     always remained for two or three hours in prayer
     after receiving Holy Communion. One Good Friday,
     he contrived to slip out of the Canon's house at
     night, and to make the Stations of the Cross in his
     bare feet. Here again, we have proof of John's
     humility and horror of notice, for we are told that on
     these occasions, in order to avoid remark, he wore
     shoes without soles; and stockings without feet. The
     Saint had a great horror of idleness. He was never
     known to lose a moment of time. Sometimes he
     studied the whole night long. This unwearied
     application and his brilliant talent, enabled him to
     distance all competitors, and to carry off the first
     prizes.
     HE DECIDES TO ENTER THE SOCIETY OF JESUS
     IN 1616 John wrote to his parents that he felt
     convinced that it was the will of God he should
     enter the Society of Jesus. He had come to this
     conclusion after much consideration and long and
     fervent prayer. His confessor, Father de Greef, fully
     approved of the Saint's resolution. Here is what he
     says about his saintly penitent's vocation: 'John
     Berchmans, who was my pupil and penitent all the
     time he was attending our college, opened his mind
     to me about entering the Society; and for the same
     end, by my advice, he used to go to Communion
     every Sunday and holiday, and later on, every
     Thursday even when there were no feast days . . . .
     Whatever bad behaviour might be in class, he was
     ever the same, modest, attentive, hardworking,
     never a shadow on his brow, and his face always
     wreathed in sweetness; he was always good-natured,
     and kind to all. One would have said he was an
     angel in the flesh. In conversation, he was always
     trying to find out, when he had to do or say
     something, what would be the most perfect. Indeed,
     once or twice by the ardour of his consideration, he
     lit up in my cold heart some flames, though feeble,
     of divine love, and the very thought of them to this
     day fills me with confusion when I recall several
     practices which I suggested to him, and which I
     have read of in his life.' John's design met with
     great opposition from his parents, especially his
     father, who wished his son to become a secular
     priest; but, convinced of God's Will, the ,Saint
     remained firm, and finally triumphed over all
     obstacles.
     'I am greatly surprised,' he wrote to his father,
     'that you, in place of loving and thanking God for the
     great favour that He has willed to do not only
     myself, but yourselves also, in calling me to holy
     religion, and .to such an Order, where men lead the
     lives of angels, and you, I say, should counsel me
     not to .listen to our dear Lord, and to put off my
     vocation for five or six months. It is not right, as
     you well know, that in order to obey you, I should be
     disobedient to God. Our dear Lord, when He called a
     young man to follow Him, would not let him go to
     bury his father who had just died, though this was a
     good work, and one which needed but a short time.
     And when He called another He forbade him to say
     goodbye to his friends, saying: 'No one putting his
     hand to the plough, and afterwards looking
     backwards is fit for the kingdom of God.' Why do
     you think He said this, if it was not to show us that
     we must follow our vocation then and there without
     delay? So then, my ever honoured parents, that I
     may obey God, our Lord, that I may make my
     salvation sure, and in fine that I may avoid that
     fearful sentence: Vocavi et renuisti; quoque in
     interitu tuo ridebo -I called and you refused; I also
     will laugh at your destruction.' I mean, with God's
     grace, in a fortnight hence to share the joys of my
     brothers in religion.'
     ENTRANCE INTO RELIGION
     On SATURDAY, 24th September, 1616, Feast of
     Our Lady of Mercy, our Saint bade farewell for ever
     to the world, and entered the Novitiate of the Society
     of Jesus in Mechlin. He was then just eighteen
     years of age, 'his face, always beautiful and
     beaming, was taking the form and shape of
     manhood.' He was poorly dressed. 'He wore a black
     cloth doublet and breeches of the same, a grey
     cloak fell from his shoulders, and a stiff white
     collar, without frills or plaits, supported by a black
     stock, ran round his neck' (Father Goldie). Another
     young student from Bois-de-Duc, entered at the
     same time. 'come, brother,' said the Saint to this
     young man, 'let us rejoice that we are in the house
     of the Lord, we must not .be found unworthy of so
     great a favour. May both of .us always live in this
     holy Society of Jesus, where God's service calls us,
     and may we meet in Heaven after long and hard
     work.' Then, noticing a lay-brother digging m the
     garden: 'There,' said he, 'we can begin at once; there
     is no better opening for religious life than humility
     and charity;' and, throwing off his cloak, he went to
     help the good brother. So great was John's delight
     at finding himself in the haven of his desire that
     throughout that happy day he could not cease from
     weeping from very joy.
     John repeatedly declared to Father de Greef,
     that in entering religion he 'aimed at nothing less
     than the most scrupulous fulfilment of the least of
     the rules of the institute.' 'I want to be a Saint,' he
     said; 'yes, and a great Saint, too! Is it possible to
     conceive that one should not attain an eminent
     sanctity with all the powerful means of sanctification
     the society has at its disposal?'
     LIFE IN THE NOVITIATE
     ST. JOHN BERCHMANS, from the very first day
     of his entrance into religion, began to carry out to
     the very letter his ideas regarding the life of a true
     religious. Hence, it is not surprising to hear that in
     one month he had made more progress than many
     made in twenty-four. The novices longest in the
     house felt and acknowledged that this latest arrival
     had far outstripped them in the science of spiritual
     life.
     John constantly repeated 'that perfection does
     not consist in doing great things, but in doing well
     what obedie nce orders and advises.' Again, he used
     to say: 'Set great store on little things'; and another
     of his sayings was: 'Do great penance for small
     faults. Be a miser and a merchant in spiritual
     things.' All his companions looked on him as sent by
     God .amongstthem to be their model of perfection.
     One of them, soon after John's entrance, speaking
     of him, said:
     'Just at the very time when our Lady began to
     work miracles= at Montaigu, she wrought a still more
     extraordinary wonder at Diest, by making an angel
     comedown in the flesh.' Such was the universal
     testimony of all whoever knew him-his. friends in
     the world, his companions in religion, even strangers
     who only caught a glimpse of him as a noviceall
     called him 'the Angel.' No other words could express
     the impression made upon them by his beauty and
     the purity which exhaled from him like the fragrance
     of some rare flower. He was also called St. Hilarius
     or St. Laetus, so bright and sunny was his
     disposition. Gloom and sadness were dispelled by
     his mere presence. One of the Fathers, after his,
     death, declared: 'I lived two years with him in the
     Novitiate: Well, I am ready to declare, on oath, I
     never noticed in him the smallest movement of
     impatience or anger.'
     HIS MORTIFICATION
     WITH ALL HIS brightness, his sweetness, his,
     gentleness, John practised the severest
     mortifications. Like all saints, he was severe to
     himself alone. 'A mother to others, a judge to
     myself.' Obedience was the only limit to his penance
     and mortification, and in his intense desire to
     imitate his crucified Lord, he actually wrung from his
     confessor permission for penances which seem to
     us beyond the powers of mortal endurance.
     We are told that 'there was kept in the Novitiate
     of Mechlin, part of a rough and prickly hair -shirt,
     which he usually wore, and cloths with which he
     had staunched the blood his scourgings made to
     flow. During the keen frosts of a Flemish winter he
     hardly ever went near a fire, though his hands and
     ears were cruelly chapped by the cold.'
     'My penance above all others,' he used to say,
     'is common life. May I die rather than violate
     deliberately the smallest order ar rule. I would rather
     lose my health altogether than not keep a rule in
     'order. to preserve it.' Again he says:
     'Rather die than for health's sake break a single
     rule.'
     HIS HUMILITY
     OUR SAINT, as we have already seen, regarded
     humility as the foundation of all perfection. Hence,
     he loved and sought .everything that could foster
     and strengthen the growth of this virtue in his soul-
     the lowest and most menial offices, the poorest
     clothes, reproofs, corrections. He repeatedly begged
     that his faults might be 'known publicly. At last his
     request was granted, and , Father Banters tells us: 'I
     told all the novices, then more than one hundred, to
     jot down and give me in writing any defects they
     had noticed in Berchmans' conduct. I got these
     notes, and on opening them found that not one had
     been able to observe the smallest defect in him.'
     Truly, a marvellous testimony to John's holiness of
     life. John's confessor encouraged the Saint in his
     love for humiliations and his great desire to be
     looked upon both by God and man, as nothing. In
     this way he prepared himself for the close union
     with God which he continually enjoyed.
     HIS LOVE OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT
     HOW CAN we describe the love of this pure
     heart for Jesus in the Adorable Sacrament of the
     Altar? Seven times a day, at least, he visited the
     Prisoner of Love in His Tabernacle, and he always
     paid a last visit just before retiring to rest. 'This
     practice, initiated by the Saint, is still observed in
     many houses of his Order.
     HIS MOTHER'S DEATH
     TWO MONTHS after the Saint's entrance into
     religion, his mother's long life of suffering came to
     an end. She died on 1st December, 1616. After her
     death Charles Berchmans resolved to devote the
     remainder of his life wholly to God. He seems at
     first to have had a great desire to enter the Society
     of Jesus; but, doubtless, his advanced age prevented
     the realisation of his wish. On the 14 th April, 1618,
     he was ordained priest and, as a mark of his
     fellowcitizens' esteem, was made Canon in the
     church of St. Sulpice, where the Saint was baptised.
     Charles, the Saint's youngest and favourite
     brother, entered the Society of Jesus four years
     after John's death, and lived to a ripe old age, dying
     in the odour of sanctity. Adrian, the second son, also
     became a religious of the Augustinian Order. He, too,
     died a saintly death, following John into eternal life
     nine years later.
     FIRST VOWS
     ON THE 25 th September, 1618, John made his
     first vows, and. a few days later he received orders
     to go to Antwerp to enter on his course of
     philosophy. The College of the Society at Antwerp,
     where our Saint resided for two months, is now a
     military hospital.
     At Antwerp, as wherever he went, John made
     the same deep and lasting impression of profound
     holiness on all who, came in contact with him. The
     Superior of the House afterwards declared on oath,
     in 1622, that 'he, as well as many others, having
     only known Berchmans during those few days,
     regarded him as a fervent Jesuit, a perfect servant
     of God, a real saint.'
     On the 18 th of October the joyful news was
     communicated to the Saint that his Superiors had
     decided to send him to Rome.for his philosophical
     and theological studies. His. departure was fixed for
     the following Monday and, with his superiors'
     permission, he wrote to his father asking him to
     meet him at Mechlin on the 20th, to say farewell.
     When John reached Mechlin, the news awaited him
     that his father had been already dead a week. It
     was a great blow, but John was a saint, and to
     saints all that comes from the hand of God is sweet
     and welcome. When told the sad news, he raised
     his eyes to heaven and exclaimed, in the words of
     St. Francis of Assisi: 'Then, I can henceforth really
     say, 'Our Father, Who art in Heaven.''
     HIS NOVICEMASTER'S TESTIMONY
     FATHER BAUTERS, the novicemaster at Mechlin,
     writing of the Saint after his death: 'During the whole
     time he lived in the Society in Belgium he was a
     striking and, as far as nature allows, a perfect model
     of religious observance, a mirror of regularity . . . .
     All of us who had the happiness, to live with him,
     have been but of one opinion on that subject. He
     led in our midst a truly angelic life by the great
     innocence of his heart, the modesty of his
     behaviour, his wondrous courtesy and gentlemanly
     manner, his peaceful way of acting, his
     perseverance in all good he undertook, his perfect
     and prompt obedience, his rare prudence on every
     subject, the fervour displayed in all he did, without
     ever losing sight for a single moment of the
     presence of God, like the angelic spirits who, walk
     ever in His sight . . . . He has made him a saint. He
     has crowned him with a crown of glory.'
     ARRIVAL IN ROME
     ON THE last day of the year 1618, John and the
     young scholastic, Bartholomew Penneman, who
     accompanied him, entered the House of the Gesu,
     after a long and weary journey from Antwerp. They
     were received with fatherly kindness by Father
     Vitelleschi, the sixth General of the Society of Jesus.
     A few days later the new arrivals went to their
     future home, the Roman College, situated close by.
     The Rector of the College was then Father Cepari,
     who afterwards wrote the Saint's life, as he did also
     that of St. Aloysius.
     LIFE IN THE ROMAN COLLEGE
     OUR SAINT'S time on earth was drawing to a
     close. But three short years remained to him before
     exchanging earth for heaven. How rich those years
     in every fruit of sanctity and virtue! We have seen
     our Saint in his childhood's home, in the Novitiate at
     Mechlin, ever growing in holiness, ever spreading
     around him the sweetest perfume of spotless
     innocence and purity. His various confessors, from
     Father Emmerick of Diest .to Father Cepari, who
     received his last sigh, all declared that John had
     nevet lost baptismal innocence. Let us listen to
     Father Cepari as he describes the Saint during those
     last years of life in the Roman College.
     FATHER CEPARI'S TESTIMONY
     'JOHN'S PERFECTION was so great that it
     extended not merely, to one or two virtues, but to
     all, and to each virtue in particular. This is a thing
     so unusual as to astound anyone who understands
     what it means to be full of the virtues which are
     called those of 'purified souls,' which St. Thomas
     rightly teaches are not to 'be found but with the
     blessed in Heaven and a few most perfect souls on
     earth. This is what we all admired in him, that in
     every virtue he showed himself to be perfect . . . He
     used, of his own accord, twice every month, to give
     me, as his superior and father, an account of his
     conscience . . . his every thought, feeling, and wish.
     I remember once while he was telling me what God
     was doing for him . . . and how he was
     corresponding with these graces, I was quite
     overcome, and I said to myself: 'O happy youth in
     whose soul God is so well pleased! O blessed child,
     to whom God has given a privilege like that gift of
     grace and original justice which He conferred upon
     Adam'! . . . In our eyes, he was so consummately
     exact and faultless that no one has ever been found
     who could say that he had remarked in John the
     smallest moral fault, or observed even a little
     imperfection in what he did.'
     FURTHER TESTIMONY TO JOHN'S SANCTITY
     FATHER JOHN BAPTIST Ceccotti was confessor
     and spiritual Father to the juniors during John's time
     in the Roman College. 'I can say with truth,' he
     declares, 'as regards the inner life of John that I
     have never found a soul of greater purity and
     spotlessness than his . . . His brethren loved and
     revered him as an angel from heaven . . . I cannot
     find words to express the idea I have of the .angelic
     purity and innocence of so spotless a religious . . . .
     I firmly believe that on his blessed soul leaving his
     body it went forth so cleansed and spotless that it
     flew straight .up to Heaven without touching
     Purgatory.'
     LAST ILLNESS AND DEATH
     WOULD THAT we could trace at greater length
     the life of this angel on earth. Space forbids us to
     linger, but enough has been said to convey some
     idea of St. John Berchman's wondrous sanctity.
     'On Friday, 13 th of August, 1621, with his eyes
     fixed on the crucifix, clasping in his hands his beads
     and rule-book, and pronouncing the sacred names of
     Jesus and Mary, his pilgrimage came to a happy
     close, and he gave back in peace his blessed soul
     into the hands of his Creator, leaving us all edified
     by his innocent and holy life, and consoled by so
     :precious a death' (Father Cepari).
     Our Saint was seized with illness on the 5th of
     August. At first no fatal results were apprehended,
     but the Saint himself seemed to have received some
     interior warning that the end was near.
     MIRACLES
     THE PRECIOUS remains of St. John Berchmans
     were placed in a wooden coffin, which was laid in a
     new vault of the Chapel .of St. Aloysius. While his
     angelic body still lay awaiting 'burial, God was
     pleased by a striking miracle to bear testimony to
     John's great sanctity. A lady, Catherine de
     Reccenati, sixty-eight years of age, for three months
     before the Saint's death had been affected by almost
     total blindness. At her request she was taken to the
     bier on which the holy remains lay. Father Aloysius
     Spinola, who was present, 'told her to take one of
     the fingers of John, and with it to touch her eyes.
     She did so, and immediately cried out, 'I am cured; I
     can see.' Again she applied the finger and recovered
     her sight immediately.'
     Many other striking miracles are recorded which
     were worked through the Saint's intercession, but we
     can only give the above.
     PORTRAIT OF THE SAINT
     FATHER CEPARI draws for us the portrait of the
     Saint: 'John was of fair height, of a ruddy
     complexion, and excellent temperament, and by no
     means thin. His face was really angelic, pink and
     white, his forehead broad, his eyebrows so thick that
     they seemed to be black, and the same might be
     said of his eyelashes. His eyes were bright and
     lively, but bashful and full of goodness and
     sweetness, and ever downcast. His nose was regular
     and slightly aquiline, his lips small and ruddy. There
     was always a modest smile playing about them. His
     hair was light . . . His hands were always quiet and
     composed upon his breast. His walk was neither
     slow nor hurried, but moderate and grave. His whole
     carriage was so modest as to strike all who met him
     . . . People would stand still to gaze at him and
     enjoy the spectacle of so rare a model of modesty.
     To sum up all, we may say that to a, pure and
     beautiful soul God gave a beautiful body to match,
     and that his outward look was an image of his mind,
     a form of justice, as St. Ambrose wrote of Mary ever
     a Virgin' (Father Cepari, Rector, of the Roman
     College). ,
     BEATIFICATION AND CANONIZATION
     ON THE 28 th of May, 1865, during the
     Pontificate of Pius IX, the Decree of Beatification
     was solemnly pronounced in St. Peter's. On 22 nd of
     January, 1888, Pope Leo XIII issued the Bull of
     Canonization.
     The Saint's precious relics now repose in a
     magnificent tomb in the church of St. Ignatius.
     Amongst the Saint's papers was found a vow, written
     partly in his blood, by which he bound himself to
     defend Our Lady's Immaculate Conception,
     PRAYER TO ST. JOHN BERCHMANS
     O LILY of purity, and model of the most exact
     obedience, St. John Berchmans! we choose thee for
     our special Patron, and we entreat of thee to obtain
     for us from Jesus and Mary, that by carefully
     guarding our senses, and by the faithful discharge of
     our several duties, we may jealously watch over and
     preserve the beautiful flower of purity. Inspire us
     with a very tender devotion, such as thou didst
     cherish, towards the Queen of Virgins, and the
     angelic youth Aloysius, whom thou so well knewest
     how to copy in thyself; and obtain for us that
     detached from every earthly thing, we may, with our
     whole strength, love Jesus and Mary, so that,
     enclosed in their hearts during life, we may come to
     love them, and rejoice with them in thy company for
     all eternity in Heaven. Amen.
     V. Pray for us, St. John.
     R. That we may be made worthy of the
     promises of Christ.
     LET US PRAY
     O God, who didst bestow on St. John wonderful
     holiness, by the perfect observance of regular
     discipline and
     singular innocence of life, grant by his merits
     and prayers that, keeping faithfully all the
     Commandments of Thy law, we may secure for
     ourselves purity of soul and body; through Jesus
     Christ, Our Lord. Amen.
     THE SODALITY OF SAINT JOHN BERCHMANS
     FOR ALTAR SERVERS A TOWN may have several
     notable buildings, some distinguished by their
     architecture or by the treasures which they enshrine,
     others by their associations with the past and the
     memories they arouse. In every town or village,
     however, there is one building which stands apart
     on a plane by itself. Other buildings may be
     architecturally finer, may have involved a greater
     expenditure of money in their erection, but this
     building stands apart as one requiring esteem-and
     veneration all its own. This building is the church,
     the House of God.
     What a wonderful place for a Catholic is his
     church or chapel. In it is the Font where he was
     baptised and became a child of God. At its Altar
     Rails he received the 'Bread of Life for the first time
     and continues to receive it constantly as the
     Spiritual Food of his soul
     From its pulpit he hears the Word of God, and
     in its Confessional he listens to the sentence of
     pardon which reconciles him to his Creator after he
     has offended Him by sin. On its Altar is renewed the
     Sacrifice of Calvary, the Clean Oblation which is
     offered up to God from the rising to the setting of
     the sun. Above all, it is in the church that dwells, in
     a special manner, Christ his Saviour Who from the
     Tabernacle invites him to come for comfort when be
     is troubled and disturbed by the cares and worries of
     life. 'Come to Me all you that labour and are
     burdened and I will refresh you'
     How great, therefore, should be our reverence
     and decorum is that House of God! With what care
     and respect should we not comport ourselves in this
     holy place where we are, in a very real sense, under
     the very Eye of God! Above all, if we are privileged
     to take part in the ceremonies in God's House, to
     perform on earth those offices which the Angels
     fulfil before the Throne of God in Heaven, what
     should be our modesty and reverence to show by our
     whole bearing that we are conscious of this great
     privilege.
     To impress upon those who are thus privileged
     to serve at the Altar of God the dignity and holiness
     of their work and to enable, them to carry out their
     duties with all .possible solemnity and reverence is
     the object of the Sodality of Saint John Berchmans.
     This Sodality was founded by Father Vincent
     Bastile, S.J., who presented a Petition to His
     Holiness, Pius IX that it be approved and enriched
     by special privileges and indulgences.
     In an audience granted on 21 st September,
     1865, Pope Pius IX gave his approval to the Sodality
     and granted the following Indulgences, applicable to
     the Holy Souls:
     A Plenary Indulgence on the day of admission to
     the .Sodality, and also on the Feast of Saint John
     Berchmans, 26th November, on the usual conditions.
     A Plenary Indulgence on each of the five
     Sundays that precede the Feast of Saint John
     Berchmans, in remembrance of the five years which
     he spent in the religious life.
     An Indulgence of 100 days for each time a
     Sodalist serves Mass, or makes a genuflection with
     due reverence in the church, or behaves himself
     with religious modesty therein.
     An indulgence of seven years to such Sodalists
     as shall recite the five prayers in honour of Saint
     John Berchmans.
     In addition the Holy Father granted that this
     Sodality can be established in any place, by any
     priest, secular or religious, with the approbation of
     the Ordinary.
     Nihil Obstat:
     Carolus Doyle, S.J.
     Censor Theol. Deput.
     Impriimi Potest:
     @ EDUARDUS,
     Archiep. Dublinen., Hiberniae Primes, Dublini,
     die 25° Octobris 1935.
